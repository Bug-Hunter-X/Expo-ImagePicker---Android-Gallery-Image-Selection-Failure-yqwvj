This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with certain Android devices.  The issue manifests as an inability to select images from the device's gallery. The picker appears to load, but no images are displayed. This is intermittent and not consistently reproducible across different devices or even on the same device at different times. The problem does not occur on iOS devices.  Debugging reveals no error messages within the Expo console log.
